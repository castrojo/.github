# Org-wide ROADMAP inventory

**Last verified**: 2026-09-02 · **Source**: `gh api repos/tuna-os/<repo>/contents/ROADMAP.md?ref=<default_branch>` against every active (non-archived) repository returned by `gh repo list tuna-os --limit 200`, which is currently **40** repositories.

tunaos#1295 and tunaos#1361 both found the same problem from different
angles: nobody — human or agent — could see at a glance which repos in the
org actually have a per-repo roadmap, so the canonical `tunaos/ROADMAP.md`
Community section kept drifting out of sync with reality (most recently:
claiming 9/42 when the real count was 15/37). This file is the
single-source-of-truth inventory that section should be checked against.

**Scope note**: `ubuntu` and `letters` are excluded — both archived
2026-08-12, confirmed via the GitHub API (`archived: true`). Archived repos
take no further planning by definition.

**Scope correction (2026-09-02)**: every table below this line through
2026-08-30 reported a denominator of 37. The real active count was larger:
`spindle`, `blueshell` and `hive` are active, non-archived `tuna-os`
repositories that had no row at all — they were not the `❌`, they were
absent. `spindle` in particular was created 2026-08-26, four days before the
last verification pass, and is now the highest-velocity repository in the org
(266 commits and 227 merged PRs in its first seven days). The denominator is a
scope problem, not a coverage problem: a table that only re-checks the repos it
already lists cannot notice a repository being created. See
`tuna-os/.github#52`.

## Coverage: 36 / 40 active repos

Roadmap coverage grew from 16/37 on August 14 to 36/37 on August 30 against the
scope known at the time; re-measured against the full active set on September 2
it is **36 / 40**. The four repositories without a roadmap:

- `kde-build-meta` — documented as superseded by `tromso`; its open retirement
  tracker (`tuna-os/kde-build-meta#19`) is the appropriate lifecycle decision
  instead of creating a roadmap for inactive work.
- `spindle` — a Matrix homeserver, and the first network-facing multi-tenant
  server software in the org. A roadmap is proposed in
  `tuna-os/spindle` (branch `strategy/spindle-roadmap`); this row flips once it
  merges.
- `blueshell` — active, default branch `ptyxis-port`, not `main`.
- `hive` — active, default branch `v4`, not `main`.

## A note on "ROADMAP.md exists" vs. reachable

Presence alone isn't enough — `tuna-os/bootc-installer` had a `ROADMAP.md`
for two days that this exact inventory method would have missed, because it
was merged to `main` while the repo's actual default branch is `dev` (82
commits ahead). This table checks `ref=<default_branch>` explicitly, not a
hardcoded `main`, specifically to avoid repeating that miss — several repos
above (`bootc-installer`, `fisherman`, `changelog-action`, `kde-build-meta`,
`mariner`, `blueshell`, `hive`) don't default to `main`.

## A note on "every repo is listed" vs. every repo

There is a second failure mode above the first, and the September 2 pass hit
it: a row can be wrong, but a *missing row* is silent. Three active repos were
outside this table for as long as they had existed, so nothing in the inventory
— not the count, not the `❌` list, not the `tunaos/ROADMAP.md` Community
section that checks against it — could report them. Re-running the block below
starts from `gh repo list`, not from the rows already here, precisely so that
repository creation is picked up rather than only roadmap absence. Refresh the
scope, not just the answers.

## Regenerating this table

This table is kept fresh by an automated workflow, not a manual pass. The
`roadmap-index-automation` workflow in `.github/workflows/` runs
`scripts/roadmap-index.py --check` on a weekly schedule and opens a pull
request whenever the live count no longer matches this file. It is the
implementation of the "proposed next step" from the September 2 pass
(tunaos#1295).

To run it by hand:

```bash
# Verify the committed table matches live data (exit 1 if stale):
python3 scripts/roadmap-index.py --check

# Or rewrite this file in place with the current live state:
python3 scripts/roadmap-index.py --write
```

The script derives its scope from `gh repo list tuna-os --limit 200` (every
active, non-archived repo — so a newly created repository is noticed, not just
a roadmap missing from an existing one), then for each repo reads
`gh api repos/tuna-os/<repo>/contents/ROADMAP.md?ref=<default_branch>` against
the repo's *default* branch (never a hardcoded `main`). It replaces the
`## Coverage:` heading, the "Last verified" date, and the table body, leaving
the surrounding prose untouched.

The roadmap check keys off `gh api`'s exit status rather than parsing its
stdout — on a 404 `gh api` prints the raw JSON error body to stdout *past* a
`--jq` filter, so testing the captured string yields false "has a roadmap"
positives. `has_roadmap()` in the script checks the exit code instead.
